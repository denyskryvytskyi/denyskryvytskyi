:computer: Software Engineer at Frag Lab working on FPS game using Lumberyard game engine.

:mortar_board: Masterâ€™s in Computer Science

:wrench: Currently working on game engine [Elven](https://github.com/denyskryvytskyi/ElvenEngine) to learn more about game engine architecture, graphics programming and how things actually work under the hood.

ðŸ¤– I'm experimenting with different [machine learning algorithms](https://github.com/denyskryvytskyi/ml-sandbox) and try my best to make something useful.

ðŸŒŽ Also I've started personal [blog](https://denyskryvytskyi.github.io/) and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx90zcUS9qnt0JInGaot2IQ) about gamedev and software engineering
